# AsyncImageView
Asynchronous image loading using imageView extension

- No third party framework or lib used, however we can use some of existing libraries/framework for better results. One good library that I know of is SDWebImageSwiftUI

- I have used MVVM and Coordinator pattern for easy navigation flow and to make the code testable. Alternatively can be MVC.
